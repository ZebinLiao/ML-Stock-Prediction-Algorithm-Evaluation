The project is simple to set up, as consists of 6 Python files that run independently of each
other.

The version of Python needed to run these scripts are Python 3.9.7. The scripts are written
using Spyder IDE 5.1.5, on Windows 10 OS, however, they should be able to be run in any
other environments with the same Python version installed, or command line.

First, install Python 3.9.7 on the system if it's not yet installed.

There are a few Python packages that need to be installed before executing the files.

Navigate to the folder of the project in the command prompt or in the IDE.

install numpy 1.24.2 using:
pip install numpy

install pandas 1.3.4 using:
pip install pandas==1.3.4

install pandas-datareader 0.10.0 using:
pip install pandas-datareader

install matplotlib 3.7.1 using:
pip install matplotlib

install yfinance 0.2.4 using:
pip install yfinance==0.2.4

install tensorflow 2.12.0 using:
pip install tensorflow

install scikit-learn 1.2.2 using:
pip install scikit-learn

The files should now be executable using the command:
python <file name>

The output should then be produced, where the graph is displayed on a separate pop-up
window, while the numerical output is displayed on the command prompt.

The graph pop-up window window may have to be closed for the model to continue to running
the trend prediction.

All 6 of these files can be run separately, producing the results of their respective model.

Note: if using Spyder IDE, the above process can be replicated within Spyder, and the "Run
file" button on top can be clicked to run the code.
